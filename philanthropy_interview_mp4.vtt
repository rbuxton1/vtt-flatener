WEBVTT

00:00:00.000-->00:00:05.500
OK, I am recording so that I can take my notes later.

00:00:05.500-->00:00:11.942
Alright, so um, as I said, the goal is kind of to think how we

00:00:11.942-->00:00:17.640
can infuse the whole region with. Connections to see Demmer will

00:00:17.640-->00:00:22.336
physically with the campus, and two. Of course the intellectual life and

00:00:22.336-->00:00:26.883
everything that's going on here. So one question I'd love to hear

00:00:26.883-->00:00:30.870
you just muse on is how can. How do you see?

00:00:30.870-->00:00:34.276
How could you see CU Denver making itself

00:00:34.276-->00:00:40.440
an indispensable asset to the Metro region? And of course, I'm asking you this.

00:00:40.440-->00:00:46.759
From your position, both as a graduate student with us, but also in your work with all of these

00:00:46.759-->00:00:53.010
different philanthropic organizations. So this question is about yeah, being an indispensable asset.

00:00:53.010-->00:00:57.420
Yeah, and so I have a little bit of experience with similar partnerships.

00:00:57.420-->00:01:03.180
When I was at the mining foundation that I'd love to incorporate here at the Denver Foundation,

00:01:03.180-->00:01:09.193
we worked really closely at the Mining Foundation with FIU with Miami Dade College and to a lesser

00:01:09.193-->00:01:15.554
extent with the University of Miami. But you know, if I, you and I was part of their strategic

00:01:15.554-->00:01:19.025
planning process when the new President came in President Rosenberg

00:01:19.025-->00:01:25.220
and they they were very interested in connection with Community. Because they are, as you know,

00:01:25.220-->00:01:31.224
being from Miami, there physically distant from sort of the urban core out in more of

00:01:31.224-->00:01:35.334
the western edge of the County. And so they really were intentional

00:01:35.334-->00:01:40.270
about wanting to to just get embedded somehow into deeply into the community,

00:01:40.270-->00:01:46.510
particularly the civic space. So they did a few things. First, they opened a campus on Brickel,

00:01:46.510-->00:01:52.750
right in the heart of the financial district is like a business branch branch of Business School.

00:01:52.750-->00:01:59.198
They have. I think several partnerships with Miami Dade County Public Schools. So they're doing,

00:01:59.198-->00:02:05.040
you know whether it's an aquaponics lab in one of the high schools or you know,

00:02:05.040-->00:02:10.141
sort of like dual enrollment types of things, with some of the high school students

00:02:10.141-->00:02:14.740
they've been very intentional developing partnerships with the public school system.

00:02:14.740-->00:02:19.892
You would often see President Rosenberg next to the Superintendent of Miami Dade

00:02:19.892-->00:02:25.768
County Schools at events all over town, so that that that just elevated there. Their profile,

00:02:25.768-->00:02:31.400
but also their sense of connectedness to the community. Because Miami Dade Public Schools,

00:02:31.400-->00:02:36.570
as you know so deeply embedded throughout the entire Miami Dade County Community.

00:02:36.570-->00:02:42.396
So I think my FIU has some some things that they've done that that CU

00:02:42.396-->00:02:47.214
Denver might might look too as well. From the philanthropic standpoint.

00:02:47.214-->00:02:54.098
We we had a leadership program. All of our leadership fellows would go through the Center for

00:02:54.098-->00:02:59.302
leadership at FIU Knight Foundation, funded a number of things at FIU around journalism around

00:02:59.302-->00:03:06.014
innovation around entrepreneurship. So the fact that they were able to embed so much in the in the

00:03:06.014-->00:03:12.700
civic fabric of the Community also meant that they were making these philanthropic connections that

00:03:12.700-->00:03:16.920
obviously serve the University and serve the broader community as well.

00:03:16.920-->00:03:22.180
So it's. All kind of one in the same. You know these philanthropic connections,

00:03:22.180-->00:03:28.330
I think just are born out of deep embeddedness by the institution in communities.

00:03:28.330-->00:03:33.210
Yeah, that's such an interesting point, because AFAIU is similar to us in so many ways.

00:03:33.210-->00:03:37.750
Like the students that it serves, the kinds of programs that has.

00:03:37.750-->00:03:42.680
But then it's totally different from us physically in terms of the physical space,

00:03:42.680-->00:03:49.010
whereas we really are at the center, at least geographically of the city. So Can you imagine anyways,

00:03:49.010-->00:03:53.010
based on your experience there, that we could even better utilized our

00:03:53.010-->00:03:56.760
physical space to make these connections? You're better positioned than

00:03:56.760-->00:04:00.898
FY you, so if I you have done it successfully despite being geographically

00:04:00.898-->00:04:05.592
distant from the urban core, and you know with traffic in

00:04:05.592-->00:04:09.750
Miami like that's a big deal. Distant from the urban core,

00:04:09.750-->00:04:14.610
getting in and out of downtown Miami tonight. So yeah, you all are better positioned.

00:04:14.610-->00:04:20.370
I should say we since undergraduate so. Denver is is better positioned,

00:04:20.370-->00:04:25.806
you know and a lot of it I think is just his presence. So certainly convenings.

00:04:25.806-->00:04:31.380
I mean having you know an institution like CU. Denver has such an incredible

00:04:31.380-->00:04:36.870
power of convening. In a post covid scenario where you could bring really interesting

00:04:36.870-->00:04:43.125
and dynamic events to campus that you would be very intentional and and bringing community into

00:04:43.125-->00:04:48.480
and and the other way around, going out into Community with presentations with speakers,

00:04:48.480-->00:04:53.294
with Community collaborations etc. I mean, I I'd love to have academic

00:04:53.294-->00:04:58.330
partners like CU Denver on some of the work that we want to do,

00:04:58.330-->00:05:01.742
whether it's around economic opportunity, whether it's around climate,

00:05:01.742-->00:05:07.490
I don't know, CU Denver's kind of. Portfolio of expertise quite as well since as you know,

00:05:07.490-->00:05:12.118
I've only been here for a year and a half, but I have no doubt that there's going

00:05:12.118-->00:05:16.009
to be areas there that are going to be in alignment with work that

00:05:16.009-->00:05:21.150
we're doing at the Denver Foundation, where we could use some of the some of the knowledge that CU

00:05:21.150-->00:05:25.224
Denver has some of the convening power that CU Denver might have. You know,

00:05:25.224-->00:05:29.960
one of the things that we did in Miami was a indicators report on quality of life,

00:05:29.960-->00:05:35.080
so we took seven different quality of life measures and we aggregated a bunch of data.

00:05:35.080-->00:05:40.738
If I use a major partner in that. As a thought partner, you know helping to construct the

00:05:40.738-->00:05:44.354
report and all of that stuff and then to disseminate it out and to have

00:05:44.354-->00:05:49.188
conversations around these things. We would look to the Miami Dade's in the in the in the FI use to

00:05:49.188-->00:05:53.412
help bring people together to talk about this this data, why it matters and then have people

00:05:53.412-->00:05:57.012
run with it was all very open source. So the intention was for people to

00:05:57.012-->00:06:01.628
do with it whatever they wanted in order to improve these different metrics. You know,

00:06:01.628-->00:06:07.100
for a Community Foundation to do that, we don't have the bandwidth. We don't have the knowledge base,

00:06:07.100-->00:06:11.960
but universities do, so we bring to the table with you know what we can bring.

00:06:11.960-->00:06:15.610
But having that partner in an academic institution for foundation is indispensable.

00:06:15.610-->00:06:21.930
I don't know that that happens as much here as it does in Miami.

00:06:21.930-->00:06:25.808
Yeah, can you talk a little bit more about like the specific ways that

00:06:25.808-->00:06:30.030
you'd like to see it happen in terms of you said one thing you said was

00:06:30.030-->00:06:36.770
climate another thing you said was I think helped make opportunitie yeah with health I mean entries.

00:06:36.770-->00:06:40.542
I assume that the Colorado Health Foundation and Andrews have have

00:06:40.542-->00:06:45.220
quite a relationship with each other. You know, for the Denver Foundation.

00:06:45.220-->00:06:50.129
One thing that we have to do is we have to look at the landscape and determine

00:06:50.129-->00:06:55.100
OK where where is their saturation of philanthropic resources and expertise.

00:06:55.100-->00:06:59.967
If we can add some additional value, great. If not, is there another area

00:06:59.967-->00:07:03.685
where perhaps there isn't that saturation and we can really bring

00:07:03.685-->00:07:08.520
you know some significant value add? So I mentioned climate, because I I,

00:07:08.520-->00:07:13.460
I think there's such a tremendous opportunity in Colorado to do work around climate.

00:07:13.460-->00:07:19.860
And I don't mean just climate change. Macro level, but things like climate justice.

00:07:19.860-->00:07:25.711
I think it's going to be a bigger and bigger issue under this administration and and frankly should

00:07:25.711-->00:07:31.800
be from a societal standpoint. I think an urban campus like CU Denver is really well positioned

00:07:31.800-->00:07:36.243
to help with the research and with policy development and things like

00:07:36.243-->00:07:40.420
that around what it means to have a community that embraces climate

00:07:40.420-->00:07:44.946
justice is one of its guiding values. You know the definition would love

00:07:44.946-->00:07:50.400
to be involved and participate in developing that body of work and promoting it out.

00:07:50.400-->00:07:55.764
Outside even of the Metro Denver area, I think that's something that has national scope. Potentially.

00:07:55.764-->00:08:01.460
What we do here, I think, and can easily translate to to what's happening in other places.

00:08:01.460-->00:08:06.770
Other large urban areas that are also, if they're not already, they're gonna start grappling with

00:08:06.770-->00:08:12.450
issues around climate justice very soon. Yeah, that is a really great point.

00:08:12.450-->00:08:18.543
Yeah, that's a great point. Um, you had phrases about innovation and one of the things that I wanted

00:08:18.543-->00:08:22.690
to say at the beginning is. And this is actually now a critique of Miami.

00:08:22.690-->00:08:27.590
I felt like every time the word innovation came up in Miami, it meant tech and entrepreneurship.

00:08:27.590-->00:08:31.620
And in my mind like innovation can be so much more expensive than that.

00:08:31.620-->00:08:35.360
And I think CU, Denver should embrace that. So we're talking about client

00:08:35.360-->00:08:39.110
talking about climate justice, like there's an opportunity to be really innovative there,

00:08:39.110-->00:08:43.720
not by inventing a nap. Now by creating a new business, but just by thinking about

00:08:43.720-->00:08:48.952
these things in different ways, talking about them in different ways. And one of the things I always

00:08:48.952-->00:08:53.580
talked about was what was? Climate gentrification and does not. I didn't coin that term,

00:08:53.580-->00:08:59.160
but it's something that as when I talk about it here, people have never heard of that. Well,

00:08:59.160-->00:09:03.238
as you know that's happening in Miami, where people in little Haiti are

00:09:03.238-->00:09:06.805
being displaced because it happens to be just slightly above sea level

00:09:06.805-->00:09:10.385
and like everything else in Miami. And so climate gentrification is

00:09:10.385-->00:09:14.350
something that I think we ought to be talking about here in Denver.

00:09:14.350-->00:09:20.403
Again with the knowledge base that institutionally CU Denver would have like that brings so much more

00:09:20.403-->00:09:25.764
credibility to a philanthropic effort to promote that conversation. Absolutely wrapped around this

00:09:25.764-->00:09:31.910
theme of innovation. Yeah, that makes me think like you know.

00:09:31.910-->00:09:36.715
I mean, I actually am doing work on climate gentrification and so this just

00:09:36.715-->00:09:41.450
makes me think like how do so then? Really this is not about doing new work.

00:09:41.450-->00:09:46.250
This is about better making the connection so that we know that the

00:09:46.250-->00:09:51.140
work is being done or that we can build on work that is being done.

00:09:51.140-->00:09:57.934
So beyond just like, say, funding that work, how do those this is really? Sophomore question.

00:09:57.934-->00:10:04.430
How do those links be? Tween philanthropy and research. Happened beyond,

00:10:04.430-->00:10:10.770
just like funding mechanisms, but you have to also understand that we were not a private foundation,

00:10:10.770-->00:10:17.732
so as a Community Foundation, we're a nonprofit group 501C3. What that means is that we have the

00:10:17.732-->00:10:23.110
ability to involve ourselves in policy to a degree that private foundations don't.

00:10:23.110-->00:10:26.810
So we went through strategic planning last year, by the way,

00:10:26.810-->00:10:33.060
and one of the main pillars that we will be launching publicly in a couple of weeks is.

00:10:33.060-->00:10:39.230
It will be much more intentional about our policy work. I'm hiring a director of policy right now,

00:10:39.230-->00:10:43.690
so that's shaping policy that's advocating for policy, whether it's local, state, whatever,

00:10:43.690-->00:10:48.150
so a Community Foundation just is a different animal within the philanthropic landscape,

00:10:48.150-->00:10:53.079
we absolutely go beyond just writing checks. And we want to be in the in the

00:10:53.079-->00:10:58.810
solutions creation business. Yeah, huh? Yeah, that's really interesting.

00:10:58.810-->00:11:05.096
You know this is a world philanthropy as well that I don't know as much

00:11:05.096-->00:11:11.890
about beyond the writing checks part beyond the the, you know, applying for grant monies part.

00:11:11.890-->00:11:17.380
So is there anything about like our unique urban setting that helps us?

00:11:17.380-->00:11:24.200
You know, leverage our place to contribute to these kinds of efforts. Policy making.

00:11:24.200-->00:11:28.880
Yeah, I mean, you're also just like us and a few blocks from the Capitol,

00:11:28.880-->00:11:33.870
so it's not just about local policy making, it's the ability to influence state policy making.

00:11:33.870-->00:11:38.506
And I mean the credibility that you know someone with the CU Denver would have

00:11:38.506-->00:11:44.168
at a committee meeting at the capital. Or you know, helping to draft legislation? I mean, I've got.

00:11:44.168-->00:11:49.160
I think it's pretty pretty immense, so I think you absolutely ought to be leveraging that,

00:11:49.160-->00:11:54.930
and it needs to come in form, not just from an academic standpoint. I think this is where

00:11:54.930-->00:12:01.570
the partnership comes in. From from a community knowledge standpoint.

00:12:01.570-->00:12:08.494
So. At every point, the fact that you're doing all the stakeholder outreach I think, is fantastic.

00:12:08.494-->00:12:14.245
I would suggest that CU Denver consider embedding that into the very strategic vision for the next

00:12:14.245-->00:12:20.602
10 years on an ongoing basis. Don't just listen on the front end plugin what you receive and then

00:12:20.602-->00:12:27.574
off you go like make it a reccuring sort of part of this vision is to always be connected and always

00:12:27.574-->00:12:33.898
be listening to what's going on. I think then you just have even more credibility when you're in the

00:12:33.898-->00:12:38.394
policy making space when you're, you know. Lobbying legislators or whatever

00:12:38.394-->00:12:43.798
for something that has bubbled up from this grassroots listening. Mechanism,

00:12:43.798-->00:12:49.950
so I think I think you're incredibly well positioned to be a force in.

00:12:49.950-->00:12:55.247
In the Denver area, and I think in the state of Colorado is so much smaller than than Florida

00:12:55.247-->00:13:00.192
and I get to send so much easier to have influence from Denver. Then you know Miami does

00:13:00.192-->00:13:03.440
reasonably Tallahassee.

00:13:03.440-->00:13:09.660
I completely agree with this kind of vision of community engagement as not a one time,

00:13:09.660-->00:13:14.725
you know, in and out kind of thing, But this ongoing conversation and

00:13:14.725-->00:13:21.670
stakeholders as an ongoing stakeholder. So, um. If I could ask you to dream a little bit,

00:13:21.670-->00:13:25.422
how could you invite like, what would you envision?

00:13:25.422-->00:13:30.050
As for a CU Denver campus? It's both the you know,

00:13:30.050-->00:13:35.860
the physical space, but you know the. The identity of the campus in 20-30.

00:13:35.860-->00:13:42.530
At that time you will you, will you know, could be a graduate of C Denver?

00:13:42.530-->00:13:46.700
You know, as well as maybe a partner with them.

00:13:46.700-->00:13:51.340
What kinds of things do you imagine?

00:13:51.340-->00:13:54.473
First, I was blown away when I got here and

00:13:54.473-->00:14:00.740
I saw the the Aurora campus and the fact that it houses all three of these institutions.

00:14:00.740-->00:14:05.952
I don't know how common that is in the United States. I've never seen it,

00:14:05.952-->00:14:10.476
but I think that's really incredible. I've actually gotten to know the new

00:14:10.476-->00:14:15.700
President CCD, who's from South Florida? By the way, she's a Latina from South Florida.

00:14:15.700-->00:14:21.135
Madelena forgot her name. Really dynamic leader and so part part

00:14:21.135-->00:14:26.786
I guess what I'm what I'm getting to is part of it is I'd like to see

00:14:26.786-->00:14:32.620
all three of those institutions really be a tremendous force and a tremendous magnet for innovation,

00:14:32.620-->00:14:37.736
but just just thought. Leadership culture, you know, I think there ought to be sort of

00:14:37.736-->00:14:44.454
a cultural footprint that that that this campus has or the community. I mean, campuses all over the

00:14:44.454-->00:14:50.210
country are often draws from a cultural standpoint as well. So what needs to happen?

00:14:50.210-->00:14:56.486
For that to be developed, and here is their ability to have you know, some kind of. Art.

00:14:56.486-->00:15:02.920
I don't want to see museum but whatever. Some kind of Gallery or something

00:15:02.920-->00:15:08.014
that brings in artists that brings in, you know, spoken word and poetry and it

00:15:08.014-->00:15:13.684
just constant vibrancy, being driven by art and culture. I think there's a tremendous opportunity

00:15:13.684-->00:15:20.608
for this campus to to have that. And I mean, in my mind, CCD is is the is probably the one

00:15:20.608-->00:15:25.318
that is initially most rooted in Community and I'm thinking along

00:15:25.318-->00:15:31.620
the lines of Miami Dade College. But unlike in Miami, my sense is that there's a real

00:15:31.620-->00:15:37.756
deep partnership between CU, Denver and CKD and Metro. And so how do you not just about

00:15:37.756-->00:15:42.620
leveraging CU Denver's position? But how do you leverage these other partnerships?

00:15:42.620-->00:15:48.140
I think CCP can help bring more of community onto that campus that then CU.

00:15:48.140-->00:15:54.946
Denver can can further leverage. So I would be looking at this more holistically than just what does

00:15:54.946-->00:15:58.532
C Denver look like in 10 years? What is that entire?

00:15:58.532-->00:16:02.600
I have to say I think it's a tremendous, tremendously exciting opportunity

00:16:02.600-->00:16:06.940
to create something unique in the dynamic urban setting. This place is also changed.

00:16:06.940-->00:16:12.258
That's why I came here because Denver is growing and changing, and you know all the vibrancy

00:16:12.258-->00:16:17.324
and everything that's going on. It brought me here. It's bringing thousands of people

00:16:17.324-->00:16:24.085
as you know here every single year. But I don't know that there's a magnet for like the intellectual

00:16:24.085-->00:16:26.100
life of Denver right now,

00:16:26.100-->00:16:31.930
in the way that this campus can become that.

00:16:31.930-->00:16:38.119
Yeah, can you? How could? Well, if it were a magnet for intellectual life, what do you?

00:16:38.119-->00:16:43.870
How do you see that? I hate to keep referring to Miami,

00:16:43.870-->00:16:49.387
but you know, Miami Dade College has the book fair. They have the Film Festival like they

00:16:49.387-->00:16:53.550
have these things that bring just incredible people from around the world.

00:16:53.550-->00:16:58.900
You know to this campus that is right smack dab in the middle of downtown Miami.

00:16:58.900-->00:17:03.944
So it brings everybody to downtown Miami. I think that's exactly what we have the

00:17:03.944-->00:17:09.196
potential doing this on this campus. Great point in the book, fair, you know the streets

00:17:09.196-->00:17:16.026
are literally just filled. With people, it's my favorite week of the year, man. Yeah, that's awesome.

00:17:16.026-->00:17:20.930
Alright, so let me let me wrap up by asking you the obligatory covid question,

00:17:20.930-->00:17:27.760
which is like, you know in this time. Of the pandemic, when all of our you

00:17:27.760-->00:17:31.930
know concepts of work and life and transportation have been disrupted,

00:17:31.930-->00:17:37.880
how does that shape or how Can you imagine the campus of the future in those terms?

00:17:37.880-->00:17:44.880
What does that look like? Or does does that change your vision of the of our campus of the future?

00:17:44.880-->00:17:50.130
What you've gone through you know that last semester and this semester with remote learning,

00:17:50.130-->00:17:57.080
but also you know your own work. Yeah, by the way. Remote learning has made it much

00:17:57.080-->00:18:02.064
easier for me to be able to do these classes then if it had been in

00:18:02.064-->00:18:06.414
person in person just because of, you know, my professional life and

00:18:06.414-->00:18:11.920
personal life and all that stuff so. I would say yeah, it is gonna change it,

00:18:11.920-->00:18:17.530
not just for CU Denver but for everybody in the academic arena and in the professional arena.

00:18:17.530-->00:18:23.462
I mean, I'm working right now with my HR person, an myops person to talk about what the

00:18:23.462-->00:18:28.090
office environment looks like post cover, and I've said like not only doing that,

00:18:28.090-->00:18:33.040
do not expect everybody to be in the office five days a week for everything.

00:18:33.040-->00:18:39.060
I don't want everybody in the office five days a week for carriage like that that to me.

00:18:39.060-->00:18:42.750
Sounds like such a waste of people's energy and time and everything else.

00:18:42.750-->00:18:46.440
Let's just get creative about how we create a much more flexible environment.

00:18:46.440-->00:18:50.390
I missed the opportunity to come together with people and mist of what happens

00:18:50.390-->00:18:54.722
when you collaborate in a group setting, etc. So we definitely want to have that

00:18:54.722-->00:18:58.942
again once we're post covid but but it's not like we were doing that 40

00:18:58.942-->00:19:02.920
hours a week like people mostly are in their offices doing whatever they do.

00:19:02.920-->00:19:08.310
Or they can do that from home just as well. So I think I think it's about tremendous flexibility.

00:19:08.310-->00:19:12.520
It's about. Maximizing the the platforms, some of which we've thrown together,

00:19:12.520-->00:19:18.390
or at least we've learned how to become expert in. Forced to do so because of covid.

00:19:18.390-->00:19:23.432
So let's just develop that a little further, and so I would challenge CU Denver

00:19:23.432-->00:19:28.719
to think not only with the campus of the future looks like what does the

00:19:28.719-->00:19:33.915
office of the Future look like like, how can you all help inform you, know,

00:19:33.915-->00:19:39.550
through your business schools and sociology Department, etc. What work life ought to be looking like.

00:19:39.550-->00:19:44.660
And you know, maybe you all convene with with the Chamber of Commerce about what post

00:19:44.660-->00:19:49.352
covid office life looks like based on your sociological understanding and

00:19:49.352-->00:19:53.756
your business understanding everything else. Those are the types of things

00:19:53.756-->00:19:59.782
where it takes you just so think outside of just the campus bubble. What you all do.

00:19:59.782-->00:20:03.550
What you all determine will probably have an impact on what others do,

00:20:03.550-->00:20:06.420
not just in the academic space, but other organizations who are

00:20:06.420-->00:20:11.320
looking to anchor organizations to say. What do we do? But when the Kobe thing happened,

00:20:11.320-->00:20:16.597
I mean, I'm calling the head of the Colorado Health Foundation. I'm calling it a few people that

00:20:16.597-->00:20:22.790
I knew so far in town. I'm like what is, what do we? What do I do? Do I close here?

00:20:22.790-->00:20:26.910
Like houses work? I've never lived through this and there we have it either,

00:20:26.910-->00:20:31.455
but here's what we're doing. So the point is people reach out to look to anchor institutions

00:20:31.455-->00:20:37.060
at these moments of inflection, to help guide the path forward. CU Denver is absolutely an anchor

00:20:37.060-->00:20:41.531
institution with the knowledge and the and the expertise. To be able to to light a

00:20:41.531-->00:20:47.039
path towards the future, just think beyond the campus walls to tell all of us what we should be

00:20:47.039-->00:20:50.460
thinking about in the post Covid world.

00:20:50.460-->00:20:56.590
Down. Yeah, this is all been awesome. Do you have any other?

00:20:56.590-->00:21:02.750
Do you have any fun? Any any other thoughts that anything they haven't covered about you know?

00:21:02.750-->00:21:08.625
See you never being that anchor? The innovation of cultural life of anything about our any

00:21:08.625-->00:21:14.270
just wishes for our future.

00:21:14.270-->00:21:20.610
Well, I I I'm sure that I will be completely invested in the success of this vision.

00:21:20.610-->00:21:25.460
And you know what you are hoping to accomplish for CU Denver future.

00:21:25.460-->00:21:31.332
So I want to be a part of that. The extent that I that I can so

00:21:31.332-->00:21:36.650
consider me an ongoing partner and you know again at the Denver Foundation,

00:21:36.650-->00:21:39.943
I'd very much love to to find ways to work

00:21:39.943-->00:21:44.896
collaboratively towards creating a better. Region, which I think is what all

00:21:44.896-->00:21:47.148
of us are sort of aspiring towards.

00:21:47.148-->00:21:52.210
[no speech detected]

00:21:52.210-->00:21:55.999
I guess you know and thinking about the the

00:21:55.999-->00:21:59.670
long term future for for the institution.

00:21:59.670-->00:22:05.790
Right now we're getting ready to to celebrate their 100th anniversary.

00:22:05.790-->00:22:10.827
And what I want our 100th Anniversary Edition is about the next 100 years. Will do it.

00:22:10.827-->00:22:17.190
Tip of the cap to the last 100 years. But we really want to think that far out into the future.

00:22:17.190-->00:22:21.390
So and I understand 10 year strategic visioning and planning and stuff like that.

00:22:21.390-->00:22:26.190
But really, CU Denver should be preparing itself to be here for the next 100 years,

00:22:26.190-->00:22:31.353
helping to fill this community in in a meaningful way. So I think that's a tremendously exciting

00:22:31.353-->00:22:38.040
opportunity and I would encourage people to be thinking in that type of really bold, grandiose way.

00:22:38.040-->00:22:44.378
OK, so final final question. When you say like you know, I imagine that say the Colorado

00:22:44.378-->00:22:50.170
Foundation will continually be connected or will be more connected. What kinds of specific things

00:22:50.170-->00:22:56.430
make those connections easier for someone in your position? Yeah, so it's two things you know.

00:22:56.430-->00:23:01.070
Just to borrow certain over overused phrases, grass, grass roots and grass tops.

00:23:01.070-->00:23:06.430
So we we have a program called strengthening neighborhoods, which is exactly what it means.

00:23:06.430-->00:23:12.734
We invest in at the neighborhood level. A lot of community organizing support. We support, you know,

00:23:12.734-->00:23:17.014
grassroots organizations that are coming together to help save the park on the

00:23:17.014-->00:23:22.080
corner or the neighborhood or whatever. I mean. So a lot of that really

00:23:22.080-->00:23:28.050
rooted neighborhood work. But then. Me and other folks on the leadership team spend a lot of time.

00:23:28.050-->00:23:32.066
Sort of. You know, with specific leadership and serving on things that the

00:23:32.066-->00:23:36.250
mayor asked me to serve on. And you know, going to chamber things that I'm

00:23:36.250-->00:23:40.167
supposed to be at so that that civic connectivity I think is also important

00:23:40.167-->00:23:43.930
for the Community Foundation is important to be connected at both sides,

00:23:43.930-->00:23:49.538
and I would say for CU Denver, it's exact same analysis. So folks at CU Denver should be involved

00:23:49.538-->00:23:53.420
at that civic leadership level and serving on those committees and and and

00:23:53.420-->00:23:59.240
on those boards and all that kind of stuff. And by the way, this is something that Mark Rosenberg.

00:23:59.240-->00:24:04.048
He does better than anybody. I mean, he isn't all of those rooms where

00:24:04.048-->00:24:08.908
civic leaders are meeting in Miami. CU Denver needs to be plugged in there

00:24:08.908-->00:24:14.120
and then find those opportunities to partner at that very deep grassroots level.

00:24:14.120-->00:24:20.290
And again, CCD might be really important partner in this regard, but there's in the school district.

00:24:20.290-->00:24:25.740
There's all sorts of organizations working throughout. Then you know, this given given sort of,

00:24:25.740-->00:24:30.630
you know your focus from an economic perspective. Those grassroots social impact organizations

00:24:30.630-->00:24:36.554
I think are great partners that keep you. Rooted, but you can't you shouldn't, I shouldn't. I can't.

00:24:36.554-->00:24:38.790
You shouldn't do one or the other.

00:24:38.790-->00:24:44.380
I think you gotta do both to be successful.

00:24:44.380-->00:24:48.004
Thank you, thank you for all of your insights. This is then awesome.

00:24:48.004-->00:24:54.848
I'm learning so much from this process. That's great, and by the way, I love that you are involved in

00:24:54.848-->00:24:59.390
the climate gentrification stuff, 'cause honestly every time I say that phrase here in Denver,

00:24:59.390-->00:25:05.681
I had to explain what I mean. Yeah, we can talk quite a bit more about

00:25:05.681-->00:25:11.590
the kinds of things that that we and my research team have found here in Denver.

00:25:11.590-->00:25:16.862
Of course, it's related specifically to manufactured housing, but when you think of that as our

00:25:16.862-->00:25:20.964
largest source of affordable housing, you recognize just just how precarious

00:25:20.964-->00:25:25.340
affordable housing is post disaster, and a lot of that for clarity doesn't

00:25:25.340-->00:25:30.540
come from the disaster itself. It comes from the regulations that get triggered afterwards.

00:25:30.540-->00:25:35.463
You know the clean up after that in. In the ways that so many communities

00:25:35.463-->00:25:39.388
have been either grandfathered in and then they are exposed to new

00:25:39.388-->00:25:44.460
regulations and hurt in the process. So so law and regulations key there. So we're very early

00:25:44.460-->00:25:50.270
on this path. But assuming that my board to the green lights moving in the direction of this clan,

00:25:50.270-->00:25:55.760
it space would love to follow up an you know, maybe just ask you to point me in the

00:25:55.760-->00:26:00.370
right direction since I'm new here, I don't know a lot of the players.

00:26:00.370-->00:26:05.437
I started getting a little know a little bit around the sort of the more well

00:26:05.437-->00:26:08.920
known environmental organizations. Um, like Nature Conservancy, those types of folks.

00:26:08.920-->00:26:14.560
But really, I want to put more of this climate justice lens on it, so would love to have

00:26:14.560-->00:26:20.280
that conversation. Yeah, definitely, and we will. Can I ask you to class related things? Sure.
